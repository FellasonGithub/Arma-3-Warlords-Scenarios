*** INTRO (Updated 16/03/2022) ***

Thanks for checking out these scenarios - I hope you enjoy them as is, or create something awesome with them!

I made these for personal enjoyment, without the desire to put the code up online. 
As such, most of what you may see in the files may be unoptimised - I don't believe i'm a terribly great coder.

A lot of the info you might find useful (as did I) for creating custom factions can be found on the Bohemia Interactive Community wiki, or here: https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3:_MP_Warlords

*** INSTALL: ***

Place the mission folder, extracted from the downloaded .zip / .rar into your profile's mission folder. 
The path will be something like: C:\Users\admin\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\<Your username>\missions
From here, you can select it in game under scenarios. 

Enjoy!
